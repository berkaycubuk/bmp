# Business Management Panel

## Problem

I have clients, and multiple projects that require my attention. Along with that, I need to find new clients, and support my current clients.

I don't trust current free solutions due to their privacy issues, and I don't want to do huge investment for the paid ones.

## Solution

Web based fully local running, privacy first panel. I know it's not the best way to solve this, but as a practice this one is a good project.

## Technologies it uses

- Go
- Svelte
- SQLite
